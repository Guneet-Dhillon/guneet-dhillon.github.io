I am currently pursuing a DPhil in Statistics from the University of Oxford, where my research topic is _Robust Machine Learning: A Predictive and Generative Perspective_.
I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. Yee Whye Teh, Prof. Tom Rainforth, Prof. George Deligiannidis, and Prof. Arnaud Doucet, and to be funded by the Clarendon Fund Scholarship.

From 2018-21, I was an Applied Scientist at Amazon Web Services, Inc.

From 2014-18, I completed a BSc in Computer Science with Honors (Turing Scholars Honors) and a BSc in Mathematics with Honors from the University of Texas at Austin, where I also completed a Certificate in Applied Statistical Modeling and a Minor in Economics.
My honors thesis was on _Training Ising Models on Images using Sparsitron_, supervised by Prof. Adam Klivans.
